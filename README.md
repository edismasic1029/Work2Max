## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/edismasic1029/Work2Max.git


3. **suggestive future improvements**
Once a recommendation is selected, add it to my workouts.
Create custom workouts that are saved into a sqlite database. 
Implement a Progress Activity that is similar to the one on apple watches where it displays the duration of the workout, the type of exercise,and the amount burned.
